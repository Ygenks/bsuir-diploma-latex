	to handle uncertainty when propagating the effects of evidence, and
	it has appeared that exact probabilistic methods are not computationally

	this claim by exploiting a range of local representations for the
	joint probability distribution, combined with topological changes
	to the original network termed `marrying' and `filling-in'. The resulting
	structure allows efficient algorithms for transfer between representations,
	providing rapid absorption and propagation of evidence. The scheme

abstract={Many applications in image processing have high inherent parallelism. FPGAs have shown very high performance in spite of their low operational frequency by fully extracting the parallelism. In recent micro processors, it also becomes possible to utilize the parallelism using multi-cores which support improved SIMD instructions, though programmers have to use them explicitly to achieve high performance. Recent GPUs support a large number of cores, and have a potential for high performance in many applications. However, the cores are grouped, and data transfer between the groups is very limited. Programming tools for FPGA, SIMD instructions on CPU and a large number of cores on GPU have been developed, but it is still difficult to achieve high performance on these platforms. In this paper, we compare the performance of FPGA, GPU and CPU using three applications in image processing; two-dimensional filters, stereo-vision and k-means clustering, and make it clear which platform is faster under which conditions.},

The results show that parallelism is essential for achieving good performance on a CPU, and that data transfer can be partly overlapped by computations to hide some of the overheads in GPU implementations. The GPU implementation was the fastest with a performance approximately 3 times faster than the parallel CPU implementation for the hardware the tests were performed on.},

abstract={The recent advances in GPU technology is offering great prospects in computation. However, the penetration of the GPU technology in real-time control has been somewhat limited due to two main reasons: 1) control algorithms for real-time applications involving highly parallel computation are not very common in practical applications and 2) the excellent performance in computation of GPUs is paid for by a penalty in memory transfer. As a consequence, GPU applications for real-time controls suffer from an often unacceptable latency. We present the factors that affect the performance of GPUs in real-time applications in fusion research in order to provide some hints to designers facing the option of using either a multithreaded, multicore CPU application or a GPU. In particular, we consider GPU usage in two common use cases in real-time applications in fusion research: dense matrix-vector multiplication for large state space-based control and online image analysis for feature extraction in camera-based diagnostics. Two applications mimicking the two use cases have been developed using the Tesla K40 GPU architecture, and the performance results are reported.},

abstract={This paper introduces a new hybrid ASIC/FPGA chip architecture that is being developed in collaboration between IBM and Xilinx, and highlights some of the design challenges this offers for designers and CAD developers. We review recent data from both the ASIC and FPGA industries, including technology features, and trends in usage and costs. This background data indicates that there are advantages to using standard ASICs and FPGAs for many applications, but technical and financial considerations are increasingly driving the need for a hybrid ASIC/FPGA architecture at specific volume tiers and technology nodes. As we describe the hybrid chip architecture ,we point out evolving tool and methodology issues that will need to be addressed to enable customers to effectively design hybrid ASIC/FPGAs. The discussion highlights specific automation issues in the areas of logic partitioning, logic simulation, verification, timing, layout and test.},

abstract={Convolution is one of the most important operators used in image processing. With the constant need to increase the performance in high-end applications and the rise and popularity of parallel architectures, such as GPUs and the ones implemented in FPGAs, comes the necessity to compare these architectures in order to determine which of them performs better and in what scenario. In this article, convolution was implemented in each of the aforementioned architectures with the following languages: CUDA for GPUs and Verilog for FPGAs. In addition, the same algorithms were also implemented in MATLAB, using predefined operations and in C using a regular x86 quad-core processor. Comparative performance measures, considering the execution time and the clock ratio, were taken and commented in the paper. Overall, it was possible to achieve a CUDA speedup of roughly 200× in comparison to C, 70× in comparison to Matlab and 20× in comparison to FPGA.},

abstract={The feasibility of run-time reconfiguration of FPGAs has been established by a large number of case studies. However, these systems have typically involved an ad hoc combination of hardware and software. The software that manages the dynamic reconfiguration is typically specialised to one application and one hardware configuration. We present three different applications of dynamic reconfiguration, based on research activities at Glasgow University, and extract a set of common requirements. We present the design of an extensible run-time system for managing the dynamic reconfiguration of FPGAs, motivated by these requirements. The system is called RAGE, and incorporates operating-system style services that permit sophisticated and high level operations on circuits},

abstract={Image processing is often considered a good candidate for the application of parallel processing because of the large volumes of data and the complex algorithms commonly encountered. This paper presents a tutorial introduction to the field of parallel image processing. After introducing the classes of parallel processing a brief review of architectures for parallel image processing is presented. Software design for low-level image processing and parallelism in high-level image processing are discussed and an application of parallel processing to handwritten postcode recognition is described. The paper concludes with a look at future technology and market trends},
